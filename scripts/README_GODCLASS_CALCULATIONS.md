**Instructions to run god class calculations script**
*The number of god classes for each repository should have already been found as a prerequisite to this script*
1) Enter the number of the god classes found for each repository in the godClassMetricsInput array in god_class_calc.py. The numbers should be entered with comma and trailing space to separate each number.
2) Run the god_class_calc.py script to get metrics for the number of god classes found per repository for this tool.

Note: This script is meant to be run separately for the data from each static code analysis tool (i.e. once for PMD data, Jdeodorant data, and Embold data)
